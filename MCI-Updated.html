        <p>In April 2012, the NIAMS, in conjunction with the NIH, participated in the 2012 USA Science and Engineering Festival. The largest celebration of science in the United States featured over 3,000 fun, interactive exhibits, more than 100 stage shows and 33 author presentations. Over the course of four days, the festival hosted over 180,000 attendees.</p>
        <p>The NIAMS’ booth provided a variety of educational activities that explained the ways bones, joints, muscles and skin are affected by diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis. The presenters also explained the function of skin, the human body’s largest organ, and how immunity develops and viruses are constructed. Through this event, the NIAMS showcased its research, distributed information and engaged children in science and research.</p>

        <p>During National Suicide Prevention Week, we remember the millions of Americans who are directly affected by more than 38,000 deaths by suicide each year.</p>
        <p>As a federal leader in suicide prevention, SAMHSA is developing a new suicide prevention app for mobile tablets. Called Suicide Safe, the app will help providers integrate suicide prevention strategies into their practice and reduce suicide risk among their patients.</p>
        <p>Suicide Safe helps providers:</p>
        <ul class="comingSoon-list">
          <li>Explore suicide prevention resources, including the SAFE-T card and easily download it for use offline.</li>
          <li>Study interactive sample cases to learn and review the five steps of the SAFE-T as you progress through case scenarios and tips.</li>
          <li>Access information, including prevention journal articles, wallet/pocket guides, continuing education opportunities, and other supportive resources.</li>
          <li>Access patient education materials, including crisis hotline wallet cards, fact sheets, and treatment resources.</li>
          <li>Browse conversation starters that provide sample language and tips for talking with patients about their suicidal ideation.</li>
          <li>Use the SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator to provide timely referrals for patients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SAMHSA's free Suicide Safe app will be available in January 2015 for iOS® and AndroidTM tablets.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Health Partnership Program Update</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-section-title">Update on the National Multicultural Outreach Initiative</h3>
        <p>We are pleased to share that in July 2012, the NIAMS received an NIH Director’s Award in recognition of outstanding efforts to establish the NIAMS National Multicultural Outreach Initiative, dedicated to reaching underserved racial and ethnic populations. This recognition signals support by the NIH, and indeed, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for the NIAMS’ commitment to address disparities in health information among underserved populations.</p>
        <p>The NIAMS recently completed its pilot study to test the effectiveness of two tailored health planners, and to analyze the distribution methods of four community-based organizations to reach multicultural communities. The pilot study gave us important insight as we plan our national distribution efforts in 2013. Among the lessons we learned from the pilot study:</p>
        <ul class="outreach">
          <li>Tailoring the health planners to meet the cultural needs of the communities was much appreciated by the planner recipients and the outreach workers who distributed them.</li>
          <li>The health planners served as an interactive tool for outreach staff to discuss health issues with their patients and, in turn, for patients to discuss health issues with their providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will develop four tailored health planners, one for each of the following multicultural populations:</p>
        <ul class="outreach">
          <li>African Americans</li>
          <li>Hispanics/Latinos</li>
          <li>American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians</li>
          <li>Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’ll need your help to distribute them to your communities! To assist you in your promotion efforts, we also will create an electronic toolkit of resources.</p>
        <p>Look for an announcement when these materials are available later this year.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-section-title">Community Health Center Welcomes New Fellows</h3>
        <p>The NIAMS has added three new fellows to its <a href="http://rheumatology.nih.gov/">Rheumatology Fellows Program</a>. Drs. Daniella Schwartz, Pravitt Gourh and Angeliki Giannelou are members of the 2012–2013 Rheumatology Fellows class. The Rheumatology Fellowship Program falls under the NIH’s Graduate Medical Education training program, which allows students who choose to pursue an academic medical career in rheumatology to obtain hands-on experience through clinical rotations and research activities. Applicants must have completed two or more years of Internal Medicine residency training in order to apply to the program.</p>

She researched heart failure and metabolic syndrome at the Cardiology Department of Asklepion Hospital in Athens from September 2007–February 2008. She continued her clinical research at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, DC, through June 2008, evaluating the relationship between exercise tolerance and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This study led to co-authorship of two manuscripts in Hypertensionand the Hellenic Journal of Cardiology. Dr. Giannelou completed a one year post-doctoral fellowship in the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland Medical School in June 2009. She completed an Internal Medicine residency at Bridgeport Hospital–Yale New Haven Health System in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in June 2012.</p>
