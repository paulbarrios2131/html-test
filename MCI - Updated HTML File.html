                        In April 2012, the NIAMS, in conjunction with the NIH, participated in the 2012 USA Science and Engineering Festival. The largest celebration of science in the United States featured over 3,000 fun, interactive exhibits, more than 100 stage shows and 33 author presentations. Over the course of four days, the festival hosted over 180,000 attendees.

                    <li>The NIAMS’ booth provided a variety of educational activities that explained the ways bones, joints, muscles and skin are affected by diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis. The presenters also explained the function of skin, the human body’s largest organ, and how immunity develops and viruses are constructed. Through this event, the NIAMS showcased its research, distributed information and engaged children in science and research.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>We are pleased to share that in July 2012, the NIAMS received an NIH Director’s Award in recognition of outstanding efforts to establish the NIAMS National Multicultural Outreach Initiative, dedicated to reaching underserved racial and ethnic populations. This recognition signals support by the NIH, and indeed, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for the NIAMS’ commitment to address disparities in health information among underserved populations.</li>
                    <li>The NIAMS recently completed its pilot study to test the effectiveness of two tailored health planners, and to analyze the distribution methods of four community-based organizations to reach multicultural communities. The pilot study gave us important insight as we plan our national distribution efforts in 2013. Among the lessons we learned from the pilot study:</li>
                    <ul class="outreach">
                        <li>Tailoring the health planners to meet the cultural needs of the communities was much appreciated by the planner recipients and the outreach workers who distributed them.</li>
                        <li>The health planners served as an interactive tool for outreach staff to discuss health issues with their patients and, in turn, for patients to discuss health issues with their providers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>We will develop four tailored health planners, one for each of the following multicultural populations:</li>
                    <ul class="outreach">
                        <li>African Americans</li>
                        <li>Hispanics/Latinos</li>
                        <li>American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians</li>
                        <li>Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</li>
                    </ul>
